					<p>The explosion of data due to proliferation of energy-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT)
						requires rethinking of computing.
						Data analytics applications such as deep learning, pattern recognition, mining has evolved as
						viable directions to
						convert raw data into actionable insights whereas post-CMOS technologies have shown promise to
						provide the desired
						scalability and create new frontiers in novel energy-efficient computing. With potential impact
						of IoT in all aspects
						of our day-to-day life ensuring their security and privacy from emerging attack vectors at
						minuscule energy/area budget
						is a challenge in itself. Our research interest lies at the intersection of circuit,
						micro-architecture and hardware
						security using CMOS and post-CMOS nano-technologies catering to these rapidly evolving needs of
						computing. We have three
						tightly connected research efforts to achieve energy-efficiency while preserving the security
						and trust of IoT in Cyber
						Physical Systems.

					</h2>
					<p>Reverse engineering (RE) of Intellectual Property (IP) for cloning and possible malicious
						tampering/Trojan insertion are major
						cause of concern for commercial and defense vendors. The state-of-the-art employs camouflaging
						of gates that leaves traces at
						the layout level or increase process cost. For IP protection there is a need to investigate
						alternate design paradigms that
						are inherently RE-resilient at conventional power, performance and robustness limits. While the
						field of hardware security
						predominantly focuses on the security and trustworthiness of IC, security analysis and
						protection mechanisms at higher level of
						hardware abstraction such as Printed Circuit Board (PCB) are scarce. With rapid proliferation of
						embedded systems in the emerging
						IoT regime, security and trust issues at system hardware level are poised to cause major
						security concerns and create new frontiers
						in hardware and supply chain security research. To achieve a high level of assurance and trust
						in system hardware, there is a critical
						need to greatly enhance our understanding of emerging vulnerabilities and explore innovative
						low-cost countermeasures.

					<h2>Data Security and Privacy of NVM
						<em>[Sponsored by NSF]</em>
					</h2>
					<p>NVM technologies such as Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STTRAM), Ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM), Resistive
						RAM (ReRAM), Phase
						Change RAM (PCRAM) and Domain Wall Memory (DWM) have brought lot of excitement in the design
						community due to leakage
						elimination, high density, non-volatility, low-power and high-speed. Significant research effort
						has been devoted to
						understand the viability of integrating NVMs across the memory hierarchy including Last Level
						Cache (LLC) and main
						memory. However, NVM LLC brings new security challenges that were absent in their conventional
						volatile memory counterparts.
						The root cause is persistent data and the fundamental dependency of the NVM on ambient
						parameters such as magnetic
						field and temperature that can be exploited for low-cost tampering. There are two aspects to NVM
						security:
						<br />
						<br />
						<em>Data Integrity</em> &mdash; It pertains to data corruption by malicious attack with the
						intention to launch denial-of-service.
						For example, the fixed layer of STTRAM is robust however, the free layer could be toggled
						through both spin polarized
						current as well as magnetic field. It has been shown that the STTRAM free layer could flip its
						polarity by a common
						horseshoe magnet! The same effect could also be obtained through temperature modulation and
						localized laser heating.
						Protecting data integrity against malicious attacks through ambient effect is particularly
						critical on deployed systems
						such as IoT that are hard to maintain and enforce physical security.
						<br />
						<br />
						<em>Data Privacy</em> &mdash; It pertains to sensitive data being compromised. Storage such as
						Hard Disk Drive (HDD) has
						traditionally been the non-volatile part of memory system that is secured by data encryption. As
						non-volatility is
						introduced at higher levels of memory stacks that traditionally were volatile more data become
						vulnerable that were
						traditionally safe. The primary challenge associated with addressing data privacy in higher
						levels of memory stack
						is performance. Closer the memory level is to CPU, the more sensitive it is to latency.
						Consequently, the latency associated
						with encryption that is used for storage is not trivial in LLC. New measures are required to
						guarantee security at
						higher levels of memory hierarchy for NVM. Considering the cost and weight of solutions such as
						magnetic or heat shield,
						it may not be practical or effective for a range of applications including many IoT devices.

					<h2>Novel and Neuro-Inspired Energy-Efficient Computing
						<em>[Sponsored by SRC/Intel, NSF]</em>
					</h2>
					<p>NVM technologies possess interesting features such as non-volatility, shift-based access (such as
						DWM) and small footprint that can be exploited
						at circuit / system level for energy-efficient Digital Signal Processing (DSP), deep learning,
						mining and recognition. The capability of the NVMs
						to transform one type of energy to another presents an opportunity of energy harvesting as well.
						Although promising, deeper inspection
						reveals that NVMs suffer from several common challenges such as long write latency, high write
						power, scalability, susceptibility to process
						variations and poor sense margin. Circuit and system level techniques are required to
						hide/exploit these challenges. The key to NVMs scalability
						is dominated by the selector device. Conventional three terminal transistor selectors pose
						barrier to scaling whereas diode selectors increase
						voltage headroom (undesirable for IoT). A suitable selector device can enable large scale
						integration of 3D stacked memory to solve the storage
						challenges in data analytics.
